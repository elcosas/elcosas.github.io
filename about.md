<p>
Hi, i'm Cole (elcosas) Saldanha! I am a aspiring computational science researcher with a 
strong interest in FOSS software and open-source ideology. I have been self-teaching myself 
computational skills since the beginning of highschool, mainly focused in linux and 
lower-level OS concepts and languages such as C.

The purpose of this blog is to act as a place to share my thoughts and experiences without
fear of being completed roasted in a comment section :)
